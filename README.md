# Seaborn-
Data visualization using Seaborn, a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides numerous examples and explanations of how to create a variety of plots including histograms, KDE plots, count plots, box plots, violin plots, scatter plots, and regression plots.
The tutorial also demonstrates how to apply advanced techniques such as jittering, nested groupings, and bivariate plotting using Seaborn's built-in functions like pairplot(), jointplot(), FacetGrid(), and more.

# Key Features:
Histograms and KDE plots: Visualize distributions of numerical data.

Count plots: Display the frequency of categorical data.

Box and Violin plots: Compare distributions and visualize summary statistics.

Scatter and Regression plots: Explore relationships between variables with optional regression lines.

Facet and Pair grids: Create complex multi-dimensional visualizations.

Customizations: Modify plot aesthetics, apply color palettes, and control figure sizes.
